### Definition: 
  - Simply is a function that has a reference ( can access ) a private variable.
  

### Example 1:

  ```
  function Person(pName) {
    this.name = pName;
    }
  const me = new Person('Islam');
  me.name;//'Islam'
  ```
  Now let's do it another way
  ```
  function Person(pName) {
    var name = pName;
    }
  const me = new Person('Islam');
  me.name;//undefined
  ```
  Instead we could use a closure to have a reference to this private name variable.
  ```
  function Person(pName) {
    var name = pName;
    this.getName = function() {
      return name;
      }
    }
 const me = new Person('Islam');
  me.getName();//'Islam'
```

### Example 2

```
function counterFunction() {
    var counter = 0;
    return function () {return counter += 1;}
}
const add = counterFunction();
add();//1
add();//2
add();//3
```
The add() refer to the returned anonymous function which has reference to the private counter variable and increment it by 1 each time the add() invoked.
If you wrote `add;` in console it will return the returned anonymous function.
```
add;//Æ’ () {return counter += 1;}
```
